## High‑Level Pipeline

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U[User Intent] --> NTO(Neural Task Orchestration)
    NTO --> DRL(Deep RL Policy)
    DRL --> AEF(Autonomous Execution Framework)
    AEF --> UI[Live UI Render]
    UI -->|Feedback| DRL
```

- **NTO** parses intent and decomposes multi‑step workflows.
- **DRL Policy** ranks interface layouts and execution paths.
- **AEF** executes on Web2 APIs, smart‑contracts, or MCP paths.
- **Renderer** streams HTML / WebGL back in \< 300 ms.

## Model‑Context‑Protocol (MCP)

Think of MCP as an “open API market” that AIVA agents discover at runtime. Developers publish **Paths** (deterministic functions) with on‑chain staking. AIVA selects, verifies, and composes these Paths on demand.
