## Utility & Flywheel

Every click you save, every UI frame you render, and every execution you trigger burns or redistributes AIVA. 

| Mechanism | How it works | Why it’s compelling |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Gas & UI Credits** | Each live-rendered component consumes micro-AIVA, similar to gas on an L1—but at the interface layer. Heavy users (bots, trading desks, SaaS integrations) naturally become steady buyers of credits. | Continuous burn \= *deflationary pressure* tied to real usage, not speculation. |
| **Execution Fees (0.3 %)** | Every swap, stake, booking, or cross-chain transfer routed through AIVA pays a tiny fee.**Split:** 50 % burn • 30 % stakers • 20 % treasury. | Users fund their own network improvements; stakers secure the protocol and share upside. |
| **Governance** | Locked AIVA \= voting power to tweak fees, approve MCP paths, disburse grants, and upgrade heuristics. | Skin-in-the-game governance keeps quality high and spam low—no stake, no say. |

**Net result:**

As adoption grows, more AIVA is burned for UI credits, more flows pay execution fees, and more paths join the MCP marketplace. Stakers are rewarded in proportion to network throughput, while the circulating supply trends downward—aligning *all* participants (users, devs, validators, treasury) around the same flywheel of usage → burn / yield → value.
