## Utility & Flywheel — Fuel for Every Click

> _AIVA isn’t just a unit of account; it is the fuel, meter, and incentive layer of the protocol._

Each UI frame rendered, each function call, and every on-chain execution either burns AIVA or redistributes it to the stakeholders who secure and extend the network. The table below breaks down the core revenue mechanisms and why they matter.

| _Mechanism_                  | _How it Works_                                                                                                                                                                        | _Why it Matters_                                                                       |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **_Gas & UI Credits_**       | _Each live-generated component (chart, table, swap widget, etc.) consumes micro-\$AIVA. Power-users, bots, and SaaS integrations continuously buy credits to keep pipelines running._ | _Usage-linked burn = deflation tied to real demand, not hype._                         |
| **_Execution Fee (0.30 %)_** | **_Levied on every swap, stake, booking, or cross-chain transfer routed through an AIVA UI. Split: 50 % burn • 30 % stakers • 20 % treasury._**                                       | _Users finance future dev while stakers secure paths and earn flow-based yield._       |
| **_Path Royalty_**           | _0.10 % micro-toll on each call to a third-party MCP path. 70 % → path creator • 20 % burn • 10 % treasury._                                                                          | _Turns any integration into a cash-flow asset, magnetising builders to the ecosystem._ |
| **_Staked Governance_**      | _Locked \$AIVA = voting power on fee curves, treasury grants, whitelist / slash decisions for high-impact paths._                                                                     | _“Skin-in-the-game” curation keeps spam out and quality high._                         |
| **_Collateral Layer (v2)_**  | _High-risk or high-TVL paths can require bonded \$AIVA as economic insurance._                                                                                                        | _Aligns security with value-at-risk; encourages long-term holding._                    |

**Flywheel Summary**

1. **More users** ⇒ more renders & execs ⇒ more \$AIVA burned.
2. **Higher volumes** ⇒ larger fee pool ⇒ higher staking APR ⇒ more tokens locked.
3. **More builders** ⇒ richer path catalog ⇒ more use-cases ⇒ step 1 repeats.

The circulating supply _shrinks_ while utility, yield, and builder upside _expand_—a mutually reinforcing loop that rewards participation without promising price appreciation.

<Warning>
  \$AIVA is a pure-utility token used for gas, governance, and security bonding. It is not designed or marketed as an investment contract

## Tokenomics

**Tax allocation (100 %) → protocol multisig treasury**

- Core dev & audits
- MCP hackathon grants
- Liquidity incentives & marketing

**Why it works**

- Fair entry window, no gas-war sniping
- Standing 5 % fee funds runway and R&D
- Rules locked and public—users know cost forever
- Treasury spend governed by AIVA stakers

**Result:** a launch that discourages bots, rewards real users, and secures a sustainable budget to push AIVA toward becoming Web3’s default interface layer.

## Long-Term Sustainability

- **Utility First, Everywhere.** Every click a user saves or path a dev exposes _requires_ \$AIVA—ensuring baseline demand regardless of market cycles.
- **Builder Magnetism.** 70 % path royalties \+ upcoming hackathon grants create an onboarding funnel for third-party talent that compounds network effects.
- **Elastic Security.** Staking and optional path-bonding scale economic guarantees in proportion to value-at-risk, keeping the protocol solvent without central intermediaries.
- **Treasury-Backed R&D.** A constant 20 % protocol cut funds audits, liquidity programs, and strategic partnerships—feeding long-term resilience.
- **Opt-in Premium Layer.** _AIVA Pro_ fees are discretionary; power-users subsidise core UX while retail enjoys fee-less base usage.

Result: a **self-feeding economy** where growth in personalised, zero-click interfaces directly translates into token utility, network security, and continuous burn—without relying on speculative narratives.
