| **Execution Fee** | Any on-chain transaction routed through an AIVA-generated UI (swaps, staking, bridging, NFT mints, etc.)                                 | **50 % / 30 % / 20 %**                         | Collected in the origin chain’s native token, auto-swapped to \$AIVA and settled per block.               |
| **MCP Path Fee**  | Micro-fee on each function call inside the **Model-Context-Protocol** (oracle queries, data transforms, trade routers, SaaS connectors). | **20 % / — / 10 %\+ 70 % to the path creator** | Turns every third-party integration into a recurring-revenue asset; creates a “dev marketplace” flywheel. |
| **AIVA Pro**      | Premium tier (higher rate limits, private memory vault, multi-wallet orchestration).                                                     | — / — / **100 %**                              | Fiat / stable-coin subscription; optional and non-dilutive.                                               |

## How the Flywheel Works

1. **Usage → Fees → Burn**\
   _Every interaction _— from a Uniswap swap to a Web2 API call — funnels micro-fees back to the protocol.\
   _50 %_ of execution fees and _20 %_ of path fees are market-bought and burned, tightening supply as adoption grows.
2. **Stakers Secure ↔ Earn**\
   \$AIVA holders who stake provide the economic security for autonomous execution (slashing \+ staking weights for critical paths).\
   They earn **30 %** of execution fees, aligning token holders with network throughput.
3. **Builders Plug-In → Recurring Yield**\
   MCP makes it _one-click_ to expose a service (DEX router, oracle, data API) as a callable path.\
   Devs keep **70 %** of every invocation — compounding incentive to integrate, maintain, and evangelize their modules.
4. **Treasury Fuels Expansion**\
   The remaining share — **20 %** execution \+ **10 %** path fees \+ **100 %** Pro — feeds the treasury.\
   Funds are earmarked via on-chain governance for:
   - Grants & hackathons (bootstrapping new UI verticals).
   - Liquidity programs (DEX pairs, cross-chain bridges).
   - L2 gas rebates & infra subsidies.
   - Strategic burns or buybacks as voted.

## Why This Model Scales

- **Network Effects on Both Sides**\
  More builders ⇒ richer path catalog ⇒ more use cases ⇒ more users ⇒ more fees ⇒ more builder income.\
  A dual-sided loop similar to App Store economics — but _permissionless_ and _algorithmic_.
- **Anti-Fragile Supply**\
  Automatic burn means net token emission is _inversely correlated_ with adoption.\
  The busier AIVA gets, the scarcer \$AIVA becomes.
- **Diversified Cashflow**\
  Three orthogonal streams (on-chain gas, off-chain compute, subscription) balance market cycles and chain congestion risk.
- **Low Marginal Cost**\
  Frontend generation is model-driven; once paths exist, incremental interfaces are near-zero cost, keeping protocol margins high.
- **Web3-Native Moat**\
  Competing chatbots can copy prompts; they **cannot** copy the on-chain network of staked paths, burn mechanics, and dev revenue sharing without forking both liquidity and builder base.

<Note>
  AIVA monetises every pixel it renders and every function it calls, while rewarding the very actors (users, stakers, builders) who drive that activity.\
  The result is a self-reinforcing economy where utility, usage, and token value rise in lockstep—providing the financial runway and community alignment to evolve from “cool demo” to _critical interface infrastructure_ for the personalized web.
