**What We Collect**

AIVA is designed to operate with minimal data collection.  By default we only process:

* **Public blockchain data** (e.g., wallet addresses, on-chain transactions).  
* **Basic usage metrics** (e.g., anonymous page views, error logs).  
* **Optional data** you provide (e.g., email for wait-list, Discord handle for support).

**Cookies & Analytics**

We use privacy-preserving analytics (Plausible) to understand aggregate traffic.  No personal identifiers or cross-site tracking cookies are stored.

**How We Use Data**

* To improve protocol performance and security.  
* To communicate product updates if you opt in.  
* To comply with legal obligations (e.g., fraud prevention).

**Data Sharing**

We **never** sell personal data.  Data is shared only with service providers who process it on our behalf under strict confidentiality.

**Retention**

We retain data only as long as necessary for the purposes stated above or as required by lawâ€”after which it is securely deleted.

**Your Rights**

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data.  Contact privacy@aiva.xyz to make a request.

**Changes to This Policy**

Material changes will be announced via the docs site and, where appropriate, via email.
