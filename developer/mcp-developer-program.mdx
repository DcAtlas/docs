## Why Build a Path?

*Publish once → earn forever.* 70 % of the call fee streams to your wallet in real‑time.

## Dev Lifecycle

1. **Register** a YAML/JSON manifest in the MCP registry.

2. **Stake** AIVA tokens for SLA; slash on failure.

3. **Earn** per invocation.

4. **Govern** upgrades proportional to staked weight.

## Sample Paths

```
// DEX price oracle  
{"name":"dexPrice","in":\["tokenIn","tokenOut"\],"out":\["price"\]}
```

```
// Live ETH gas  
{"name":"gasNow","in":\[\],"out":\["gwei"\]}
```

```
// NFT floor price  
{"name":"nftFloor","in":\["slug"\],"out":\["floorETH","volume"\]}
```
